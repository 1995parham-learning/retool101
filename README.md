## Introduction

Retool helps you to build admin panels and dashboards with ease. Because of internet issues in Iran, I am going to use its on-promise setup.

## [Step-by-Step](https://retool.com/self-hosted)

- Deploy Retool locally as a docker container with this one-line script:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tryretool/retool-onpremise/ssop/deploy-retool)"
```

- Add your auto-generated license key to the .env file.
- Easily connect to any local databases or internal APIs
- Build and launch apps for your users!
